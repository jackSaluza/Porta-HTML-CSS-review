Let's make a pizza restaurant menu page

start by sourcing in CSS

Check to make sure it's linked

--Create A Header--
- header is a container element:
    Elements used to contain other elements. Some have an implied meaning or usage, but all of them act like divs in terms of layout and style. (like <header>, <footer>, <main>)
- Add an h1 for the header with our restaurant name
    opening tag and closing tag

- add an image
    self closing tag

    Some elements allow optional additional parameters called attributes which help spcodecify more about this particular element. Attributes include a specific keyword(src, class), an equal sign, and a value in double quotes (filname, className).
        <img src="fileName.img" class="pizzaImg"/>

- add a link to pizza Wiki
    difference between opening in same page or new page

- maybe turn our image into the link


--Create a Footer--
use < href="mailto"> to create a contact us link

add an h6 for a copy right

--Create a Content Block--

We're going to create a menu, so I'm going to use some list properties

Use a UL for types, and an OL to list the specific items

Create a table with Pizza Prices

Add a button for ordering - buttons are different than links - use buttons for clicking (accessibility)

----------------------------------
Once I get all my HTML on the page, THEN I like to style it.

Hard to style and then do more HTML and then style and then do more HTML - could be kinda like shoveling while it's raining

--Header Style--
- Use IDs when possible
- Add a background color
- center the image
- make h1 pretty
- remove underline on link

--Content Style--
- remove bullets from UL
- add a border
- center div
- make font look neat

--Footer Style--
- add background color
- make it absolute with a left of 0 and width of 99% to fill up the space
